## Difficulties in E-commerce | Marketing | Poster Image Translation

Generally speaking, due to the complexity of copywriting, typography and color scheme, image translation will produce various problems, as follows:

| Difficulty | Problem |
| --- | --- |
| Complex typography, text or structure with certain typography and layout | The translated typesetting is unreasonable and not aligned according to the original rules. |
| Promotional copy will have base color, font will have color and stroke | After translation, the base color recovery is uneven, the font size is not uniform, and the extraction is not accurate. |
| Scene and text recognition errors | Wrong identification, wrong erase, missed erase |
| The product picture may have the text of the product itself (product text or scene text). | Product text was also erased by mistake |

The main image of the e-commerce, the publicity image of the foreign trade industry, the marketing poster, the social media picture, and the marketing picture of most industries all have similar problems as above. But the characteristics of picture translation scenarios for animation and games are different, and the problems that are prone to occur are also different. 

In the image translation scenario, most companies have a barely 50-60% availability in the basic erasure, text backfilling and typesetting layout. After the translated image is manually edited by the image editor, it can basically reach 70-80% availability. The image editor is very useful for the secondary editing after image translation, but each manual editing takes a long time to adjust the uniform color and reasonable typesetting style, which is very unfriendly to customers who handle batch processing and large-scale image translation. In order to improve the first availability rate of product pictures after translation, we need to fully optimize the translation quality, erasure effect and backfilling effect, so as to avoid secondary adjustment as much as possible.

## JollyToday Technology - AI Image Translation Features

JollyToday's image translation service is a newly launched. It’s an AI image translation product. It integrates multiple latest AI models, optimizes the translation quality, style layout and text backfilling as a whole, and improves the quality of picture translation to a new level. Compared to all image translation service providers in the world, it has the following characteristics:

- [Optimized erasing algorithm] Erasing is also cleaner
- [Optimized font control] The font size is more unified and the size is more consistent.
- [Optimize typesetting layout] Consider typesetting layout as a whole, left alignment, center alignment, and right alignment will be counted, which is more neat and beautiful.
- [Optimize image precision] Low-precision images will increase the clarity model and make the picture clearer
- [Optimize product text recognition] You can identify whether there is text on the product, and you can choose to translate or not.
- [Optimized slanted text recognition] Can recognize slanted and vertical text and restore slanted/vertical text

In order to facilitate everyone's understanding, we have made a comprehensive comparison with multiple image translation manufacturers, including Alibaba Cloud Ali Cloud Aliyun, Baidu, iFLYTEK, NetEase and some entrepreneurial friends, in multiple identical datasets. The comparative effect data is as follows:

| Indicator | jollytoday rates | other’s rates | Lift ratio | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perfect rate in first translation | 35% | 20% | 75%↑ | Replicate the original image perfectly in terms of translation quality, erasure effect and style backfilling |
| Availability rate in first translation  | 72% | 60% | 20%↑ | No obvious erasure marks, no leakage, etc., only defects in font color, size and layout |
| Total unavailability rate | 15% | 20% | 25%↓ | There are obvious leaks, leaks, and unacceptable erasure marks |

The number of first-time perfect images and the first-time availability rate after translation have greatly increased, and completely unavailable images have also dropped significantly. Improve the usage rate of product images across the board.

Applicable customers: Customers in various industries at home and abroad who need to process image erasure and image translation quickly and in batches, especially independent stations, major e-commerce platforms, and large sellers with many SKUs and fast new launches. BTW , since the dataset has a greater impact on the statistical results of the data, and the aesthetic evaluation of the picture has a greater subjective consideration, the above indicators are for reference only. You can do more actual measurements in JollyToday Technology to come from the line.
